Here is a simple TODO list
Everyone can comment here if he/she has any idea of plan

Step 1: Implement a secure messaging functionality (client-server architecture)

    a):Registration: After a client has been started, it registers at the server,
                     providing its id, first name, last name, and public key.

                    (Tianchen: If my understanding is correct, we are going to implement
                    something like: def register(first_name, last_name):
                    client provide full name, the def will generate a unique id and public key
                    for him, then generate a json file similar to the json file examples)

    b):If the registration was successful, the server sends an acknowledgement. Otherwise, the server returns an error.
                    (Tianchen: I think socket already solve this problem, we just need to
                    run the serve, from YouTube, I saw a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbfe3-v7yE0
                    when client register successfully, the server will send an acknowledgement,
                    I copy the simple code in Scripts folder, start two terminal in your computer,
                    run ss.py first, run cc1.py in another terminal, you will see the acknowledgement message
                    We can modify it later)

    c):Send message
                    ()
